Core Concepts
=============

This is a very light weight [wiki](/Concepts/Wiki.md) system that essentially loads [markdown](/Concepts/Markdown.md) and converts it to html on the fly.

The system is hosted in a [Cassini web server](/Concepts/Cassini.md) so it is portable, and can run from any directory.
