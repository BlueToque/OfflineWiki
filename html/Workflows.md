Workflows
=========

A workflow is a set of tasks designed  to accomplish a goal. Some are very simple such as opening and saving a map, others can be more complex like creating a GeoPDF. Workflows are categorized here.

Simple
------
These workflows all happen to be on the [main menu](Concepts/Menu.md)

* [New](Workflows/CreateMap.md)
	Create a new map from a template or another map.

* [Open](Workflows/OpenMap.md)
	Open a previously saved map

* [Save](Workflows/SaveMap.md)
	Save a map

* [Import](Workflows/ImportFile.md)
	Import data from an external program, database or online

* [Export](Workflows/ExportFile.md)
	Export data to an external data source.

* [Print](Workflows/ImportMap.md)
	Print a map or a report

GPS
---
The GPS Workflow handles reading and writing data to a GPS. This can be complex because there are many different types of GPS units, and not all of them behave the same or support all the same features, and TrueNorth does not support all the features of every GPS unit.
