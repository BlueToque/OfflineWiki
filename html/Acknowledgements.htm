    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>
        TrueNorth is the result of over four years of work on the part of a single programmer, but it by no means is the result 
        of the efforts of a single person. While I have contributed the labour and the expertise, without the support of my
        friends and family, this program would not have been possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of the core ideas for TrueNorth came from the many discussions and complaints I have heard from Search and Rescue 
        volunteers, myself included, before, during and after searches. It's the worst thing in the world to be asked to 
        search for a missing person in the middle of a cold rainy night, but being given a terrible map makes the experience
        frustrating, dangerous, and sometimes futile. From this inspiration, this project was born; that SAR members should 
        have access to professional quality maps and never have to go into the field with a photocopied air photo again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the years I've worked on this project, I have taken input from experts in the SAR field whose
        experience far outstrips my own, and incorporated those ideas into the software. Things like simple
        printing, easy coordinate entry, and keeping it extremely simple were the major points, and these you
        can see in the finished product.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because this project was started to ease the pain of SAR members, and because of their input, I dedicate this project 
        to you; your dedication and courage saves the lives of people every day. I hope this tool makes your job easier.
    </p>
    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>
        I also drew inspiraiton from the people around me who had a vision and follwed it, with great risk. My half sister 
        and her partner, my former employer and good friend Thomas, and others. You were my insiprations to keep at it, even when
        it seemed like too much work.
    </p>
    <h3>Thanks, and credit to</h3>

        And finally, such a long journey would not be possible without the support and encouragement of my family, and in particular my 
        partner Sylvia. I was laid off from my job two weeks before the birth of our son Eamon, and was in the middle of 
        deciding whether to make TrueNorth my next venture, or to try and get another position as soon as possible. She is the
        one who said that it was time for me to follow this deam, although if she knew it was going to take another three years
        she may have said otherwise. Without her moral support, and additional work around the house to support my volunteer 
        work with SAR, this project would not have happened.
    </p>

        My dreams for this project are big, but even if nobody ever uses it I feel that the things I hyave learned and the 
        friends I have made along the way have already gimen me some reward. Here is hoping that the users of TrueNorth find
        it useful, and that it makes your lives easier.
