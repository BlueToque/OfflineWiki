#Cassini Web Server

We use the CassiniDev web server for this project, [hosted at CodePlex](https://cassinidev.codeplex.com/)

Cassini was the code name for the internet Microsoft Development server. The source code became open source and various projects picked it up and currently maintain it. 
The server is tiny and lightweight. The provided command file launches the server, then launches the default web browser to open the index.html file.
